ðŸ”¹ Project Overview: We've developed a robust DevOps pipeline, streamlining processes from code commits to production deployment.

ðŸ”¹ Key Components: Git for version control, SonarQube for code analysis, NPM for dependency management, Trivy for security scanning, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration.

ðŸ”¹ Monitoring: Post-deployment monitoring with Prometheus ensures operational performance and reliability.

ðŸ”¹ Outcome: Reduced manual errors, improved deployment times, and increased development agility.

ðŸ”¹ Reflection: Building this pipeline taught us the power of automation and careful tool selection in transforming the software development lifecycle.
